CONCATENATE,"Use CONCATENATE, one of the text functions, to join two or more text strings into one string.                   Important:?In Excel 2016, Excel Mobile, and Excel Online, this function has been replaced with the CONCAT function. Although the CONCATENATE function is still available for backward compatibility, you should consider using CONCAT from now on. This is because CONCATENATE may not be available in future versions of Excel.      ","Syntax: CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...)

SUMIF,"You use the SUMIF function to sum the values in a range that meet criteria that you specify. For example, suppose that in a column that contains numbers, you want to sum only the values that are larger than 5. You can use the following formula: =SUMIF(B2:B25,"">5"")        This video is part of a training course called Add numbers in Excel 2013.                   Tips:?                If you want, you can apply the criteria to one range and sum the corresponding values in a different range. For example, the formula =SUMIF(B2:B5, ""John"", C2:C5) sums only the values in the range C2:C5, where the corresponding cells in the range B2:B5 equal ""John.""

The range of cells that you want evaluated by criteria. Cells in each range must be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers. Blank and text values are ignored. The selected range may contain dates in standard Excel format (examples below).                              criteria???Required. The criteria in the form of a number, expression, a cell reference, text, or a function that defines which cells will be added. For example, criteria can be expressed as 32, "">32"", B5, ""32"", ""apples"", or TODAY().                              Important:?Any text criteria or any criteria that includes logical or mathematical symbols must be enclosed in double quotation marks (""). If the criteria is numeric, double quotation marks are not required.                                      sum_range???Optional. The actual cells to add, if you want to add cells other than those specified in the range argument. If the sum_range argument is omitted, Excel adds the cells that are specified in the range argument (the same cells to which the criteria is applied).                  You can use the wildcard characters?the question mark (?) and asterisk (*)?as the criteria argument. A question mark matches any single character; an asterisk matches any sequence of characters. If you want to find an actual question mark or asterisk, type a tilde (~) preceding the character.          "
AutoFilter,"	    By filtering information in a worksheet, you can find values quickly. You can filter on one or more columns of data. With filtering, you can control not only what you want to see, but what you want to exclude. You can filter based on choices you make from a list, or you can create specific filters to focus on exactly the data that you want to see.    You can search for text and numbers when you filter by using the Search box in the filter interface.    When you filter data, entire rows are hidden if values in one or more columns don't meet the filtering criteria. You can filter on numeric or text values, or filter by color for cells that have color formatting applied to their background or text.  ","How?                                                              Select the data that you want to filter????

Click the arrow    in the column header to display a list in which you can make filter choices.                                  Note????Depending on the type of data in the column, Microsoft Excel displays either Number Filters or Text Filters in the list.                                                                                              Filter by selecting values or searching????            Selecting values from a list and searching are the quickest ways to filter. When you click the arrow in a column that has filtering enabled, all values in that column appear in a list.                        1. Use the Search box to enter text or numbers on which to search            2. Select and clear the check boxes to show values that are found in the column of data            3. Use advanced criteria to find values that meet specific conditions                            To select by values, in the list, clear the (Select All) check box. This removes the check marks from all the check boxes. Then, select only the values you want to see, and click OK to see the results.

By specifying conditions, you can create custom filters that narrow down the data in the exact way that you want. You do this by building a filter. If you've ever queried data in a database, this will look familiar to you.                            Point to either Number Filters or Text Filters in the list. A menu appears that allows you to filter on various conditions.                                              Choose a condition and then select or enter criteria. Click the And button to combine criteria (that is, two or more criteria that must both be met), and the Or button to require only one of multiple conditions to be met.

AVERAGE,"	    Let's say you want to find the average number of days to complete a milestone in a project or the average temperature on a particular day over a 10-year time span. There are several ways to calculate the average of a group of numbers.    The AVERAGE function measures central tendency, which is the location of the center of a group of numbers in a statistical distribution. The three most common measures of central tendency are:                      Average???? which is the arithmetic mean, and is calculated by adding a group of numbers and then dividing by the count of those numbers. For example, the average of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 30 divided by 6, which is 5.                               Median???? which is the middle number of a group of numbers; that is, half the numbers have values that are greater than the median, and half the numbers have values that are less than the median. For example, the median of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 4.                              Mode???? which is the most frequently occurring number in a group of numbers. For example, the mode of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 3.          For a symmetrical distribution of a group of numbers, these three measures of central tendency are all the same. For a skewed distribution of a group of numbers, they can be different.  ","Calculate the average of numbers in a contiguous row or column            Click a cell below or to the right of the numbers for which you want to find the average.                      On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the arrow next to  AutoSum , click Average, and then press ENTER.            ","Calculate the average of numbers not in a contiguous row or column    To do this task, use the AVERAGE function.

LOOKUP,"	    Use LOOKUP, one of the lookup and reference functions, when you need to look in a single row or column and find a value from the same position in a second row or column.    For example, let's say you know the part number for an auto part, but you don't know the price. You can use the LOOKUP function to return the price in cell H2 when you enter the auto part number in cell H1.         Use the LOOKUP function to search one row or one column. In the above example, we're searching prices in column D.     Use VLOOKUP to search one row or column, or to search multiple rows and columns (like a table). It's a much improved version of LOOKUP. Watch this video about how to use VLOOKUP.  ","There are two ways to use LOOKUP: Vector form and Array form                      Vector form: Use this form of LOOKUP to search one row or one column for a value. Use the vector form when you want to specify the range that contains the values that you want to match.  For example, if you want to search for a value in column A, down to row 6.                                       Array form: We strongly recommend using VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP instead of the array form. Watch this video about using VLOOKUP. The array form is provided for compatibility with other spreadsheet programs, but it's functionality is limited.           An array is a collection of values in rows and columns (like a table) that you want to search.  For example, if you want to search columns A and B, down to row 6.  LOOKUP will return the nearest match.  To use the array form, your data must be sorted.                     ","Vector form    The vector form of LOOKUP looks in a one-row or one-column range (known as a vector) for a value and returns a value from the same position in a second one-row or one-column range.       If the LOOKUP function can't find the lookup_value, the function matches the largest value in lookup_vector that is less than or equal to lookup_value.                          If lookup_value is smaller than the smallest value in lookup_vector, LOOKUP returns the #N/A error value.              "
VLOOKUP,"	    Use VLOOKUP, one of the lookup and reference functions, when you need to find things in a table or a range by row. For example, look up a price of an automotive part by the part number.    In its simplest form, the VLOOKUP function says:    =VLOOKUP(Value you want to look up, range where you want to lookup the value, the column number in the range containing the return value, Exact Match or Approximate Match ? indicated as 0/FALSE or 1/TRUE).        This video is part of a training course called VLOOKUP: When and how to use it.                  Tip:?The secret to VLOOKUP is to organize your data so that the value you look up (part number) is to the left of the return value you want to find (price of the part).

(required)                                            The value you want to look up. The value you want to look up must be in the first column of the range of cells you specify in table-array .                For example, if table-array spans cells B2:D7, then your lookup_value must be in column B. See the graphic below. Lookup_value can be a value or a reference to a cell.                                                            table_array??? (required)                                            The range of cells in which the VLOOKUP will search for the lookup_value and the return value.                The first column in the cell range must contain the lookup_value (for example, Last Name in the picture below.) The cell range also needs to include the return value (for example, First Name in the graphic below) you want to find.

HLOOKUP,"	    This article describes the formula syntax and usage of the HLOOKUP?function in Microsoft Excel.  ","Description    Searches for a value in the top row of a table or an array of values, and then returns a value in the same column from a row you specify in the table or array. Use HLOOKUP when your comparison values are located in a row across the top of a table of data, and you want to look down a specified number of rows. Use VLOOKUP when your comparison values are located in a column to the left of the data you want to find.    The H in HLOOKUP stands for ""Horizontal.""  ","Syntax    HLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, [range_lookup])    The HLOOKUP function syntax has the following arguments:                      Lookup_value????Required. The value to be found in the first row of the table. Lookup_value can be a value, a reference, or a text string.                              Table_array????Required. A table of information in which data is looked up. Use a reference to a range or a range name.                    The values in the first row of table_array can be text, numbers, or logical values.                                If range_lookup is TRUE, the values in the first row of table_array must be placed in ascending order: ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2,... , A-Z, FALSE, TRUE; otherwise, HLOOKUP may not give the correct value. If range_lookup is FALSE, table_array does not need to be sorted.                                Uppercase and lowercase text are equivalent.                                Sort the values in ascending order, left to right. For more information, see Sort data in a range or table.                                          Row_index_num????Required. The row number in table_array from which the matching value will be returned. A row_index_num of 1 returns the first row value in table_array, a row_index_num of 2 returns the second row value in table_array, and so on. If row_index_num is less than 1, HLOOKUP returns the #VALUE! error value; if row_index_num is greater than the number of rows on table_array, HLOOKUP returns the #REF! error value.                              Range_lookup????Optional. A logical value that specifies whether you want HLOOKUP to find an exact match or an approximate match. If TRUE or omitted, an approximate match is returned. In other words, if an exact match is not found, the next largest value that is less than lookup_value is returned. If FALSE, HLOOKUP will find an exact match. If one is not found, the error value #N/A is returned.          "
MATCH,"The MATCH function searches for a specified item in a range of cells, and then returns the relative position of that item in the range. For example, if the range A1:A3 contains the values 5, 25, and 38, then the formula =MATCH(25,A1:A3,0) returns the number 2, because 25 is the second item in the range.                      Tip:?Use MATCH instead of one of the LOOKUP functions when you need the position of an item in a range instead of the item itself. For example, you might use the MATCH function to provide a value for the row_num argument of the INDEX function.      ","Syntax    MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])    The MATCH function syntax has the following arguments:                      lookup_value????Required. The value that you want to match in lookup_array. For example, when you look up someone's number in a telephone book, you are using the person's name as the lookup value, but the telephone number is the value you want.The lookup_value argument can be a value (number, text, or logical value) or a cell reference to a number, text, or logical value.                              lookup_array????Required. The range of cells being searched.                              match_type????Optional. The number -1, 0, or 1. The match_type argument specifies how Excel matches lookup_value with values in lookup_array. The default value for this argument is 1.The following table describes how the function finds values based on the setting of the match_type argument.                                    Match_type                                                          Behavior                                          1 or omitted                                              MATCH finds the largest value that is less than or equal to lookup_value. The values in the lookup_array argument must be placed in ascending order, for example: ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., A-Z, FALSE, TRUE.                              0                                              MATCH finds the first value that is exactly equal to lookup_value. The values in the lookup_array argument can be in any order.                              -1                                              MATCH finds the smallest value that is greater than or equal tolookup_value. The values in the lookup_array argument must be placed in descending order, for example: TRUE, FALSE, Z-A, ...2, 1, 0, -1, -2, ..., and so on.                                    MATCH returns the position of the matched value within lookup_array, not the value itself. For example, MATCH(""b"",{""a"",""b"",""c""},0) returns 2, which is the relative position of ""b"" within the array {""a"",""b"",""c""}.                              MATCH does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters when matching text values.                    If MATCH is unsuccessful in finding a match, it returns the #N/A error value.                    If match_type is 0 and lookup_value is a text string, you can use the wildcard characters?? the question mark (?) and asterisk (*)?? in the lookup_value argument. A question mark matches any single character; an asterisk matches any sequence of characters. If you want to find an actual question mark or asterisk, type a tilde (~) before the character.

PV,"      PV, one of the financial functions, calculates the present value of a loan or an investment, based on a constant interest rate. You can use PV with either periodic, constant payments (such as a mortgage or other loan), or a future value that's your investment goal.        Use the Excel Formula Coach to find the present value (loan amount) you can afford, based on a set monthly payment. At the same time, you'll learn how to use the PV function in a formula.    Or, use the Excel Formula Coach to find the present value of your financial investment goal.  ","Syntax    PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])    The PV function syntax has the following arguments:                      Rate????Required. The interest rate per period. For example, if you obtain an automobile loan at a 10 percent annual interest rate and make monthly payments, your interest rate per month is 10%/12, or 0.83%. You would enter 10%/12, or 0.83%, or 0.0083, into the formula as the rate.                              Nper????Required. The total number of payment periods in an annuity. For example, if you get a four-year car loan and make monthly payments, your loan has 4*12 (or 48) periods. You would enter 48 into the formula for nper.                              Pmt????Required. The payment made each period and cannot change over the life of the annuity. Typically, pmt includes principal and interest but no other fees or taxes. For example, the monthly payments on a $10,000, four-year car loan at 12 percent are $263.33. You would enter -263.33 into the formula as the pmt. If pmt is omitted, you must include the fv argument.                              Fv????Optional. The future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (the future value of a loan, for example, is 0). For example, if you want to save $50,000 to pay for a special project in 18 years, then $50,000 is the future value. You could then make a conservative guess at an interest rate and determine how much you must save each month. If fv is omitted, you must include the pmt argument.

For example, a car loan or a mortgage is an annuity. For more information, see the description for each annuity function.                    In annuity functions, cash you pay out, such as a deposit to savings, is represented by a negative number; cash you receive, such as a dividend check, is represented by a positive number. For example, a $1,000 deposit to the bank would be represented by the argument -1000 if you are the depositor and by the argument 1000 if you are the bank.

Date,The DATE function returns the sequential serial number that represents a particular date.,,"Syntax: DATE(year,month,day) The DATE function syntax has the following arguments: Year    Required. The value of the year argument can include one to four digits. Excel interprets the year argument according to the date system your computer is using. By default, Microsoft Excel for Windows uses the 1900 date system, which means the first date is January 1, 1900. TIP: Use four digits for the year argument to prevent unwanted results. For example, ""07"" could mean ""1907"" or ""2007."" Four digit years prevent confusion. If year is between 0 (zero) and 1899 (inclusive), Excel adds that value to 1900 to calculate the year. For example, DATE(108,1,2) returns January 2, 2008 (1900+108). If year is between 1900 and 9999 (inclusive), Excel uses that value as the year. For example, DATE(2008,1,2) returns January 2, 2008. If year is less than 0 or is 10000 or greater, Excel returns the #NUM! error value. Month    Required. A positive or negative integer representing the month of the year from 1 to 12 (January to December). If month is greater than 12, month adds that number of months to the first month in the year specified. For example, DATE(2008,14,2) returns the serial number representing February 2, 2009. If month is less than 1, month subtracts the magnitude of that number of months, plus 1, from the first month in the year specified. For example, DATE(2008,-3,2) returns the serial number representing September 2, 2007. Day    Required. A positive or negative integer representing the day of the month from 1 to 31. If day is greater than the number of days in the month specified, day adds that number of days to the first day in the month. For example, DATE(2008,1,35) returns the serial number representing February 4, 2008. If day is less than 1, day subtracts the magnitude that number of days, plus one, from the first day of the month specified. For example, DATE(2008,1,-15) returns the serial number representing December 16, 2007."
Pivot Table,"A PivotTable is an interactive way to quickly summarize large amounts of data. You can use a PivotTable to analyze numerical data in detail, and answer unanticipated questions about your data. A PivotTable is especially designed for: Querying large amounts of data in many user-friendly ways. Subtotaling and aggregating numeric data, summarizing data by categories and subcategories, and creating custom calculations and formulas. Expanding and collapsing levels of data to focus your results, and drilling down to details from the summary data for areas of interest to you. Moving rows to columns or columns to rows (or ""pivoting"") to see different summaries of the source data. Filtering, sorting, grouping, and conditionally formatting the most useful and interesting subset of data enabling you to focus on just the information you want. Presenting concise, attractive, and annotated online or printed reports.",,
Pivot Chart,"PivotCharts provide graphical representations of the data in their associated PivotTables. PivotCharts are also interactive. When you create a PivotChart, the PivotChart Filter Pane appears. You can use this filter pane to sort and filter the PivotChart's underlying data. Changes that you make to the layout and data in an associated PivotTable are immediately reflected in the layout and data in the PivotChart and vice versa. PivotCharts display data series, categories, data markers, and axes just as standard charts do. You can also change the chart type and other options such as the titles, the legend placement, the data labels, the chart location, and so on.",,
Macro,"A macro is a tool that allows you to automate tasks and add functionality to your forms, reports, and controls. For example, if you add a command button to a form, you associate the button's OnClick event to a macro, and the macro contains the commands that you want the button to perform each time it is clicked. In Access, it is helpful to think of macros as a simplified programming language that you write by building a list of actions to perform. When you build a macro, you select each action from a drop-down list and then fill in the required information for each action. Macros enable you to add functionality to forms, reports, and controls without writing code in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module. Macros provide a subset of the commands that are available in VBA, and most people find it easier to build a macro than to write VBA code.",,
Referencing,"By default, a cell reference is relative. For example, when you refer to cell A2 from cell C2, you are actually referring to a cell that is two columns to the left (C minus A), and in the same row (2). A formula that contains a relative cell reference changes as you copy it from one cell to another. As an example, if you copy the formula =A2+B2 from cell C2 to D2, the formula in D2 adjusts to the right by one column and becomes =B2+C2. If you want to maintain the original cell reference in this example when you copy it, you make the cell reference absolute by preceding the columns (A and B) and row (2) with a dollar sign ($). Then, when you copy the formula =$A$2+$B$2 from C2 to D2, the formula stays exactly the same. In less frequent cases, you may want to make a cell reference ""mixed"" by preceding either the column or the row value with a dollar sign to ""lock"" either the column or the row (for example, $A2 or B$3).",,

Time Value,"Time affects the value of money. If you have to choose between $100 today and the same amount five  years from now, the obvious choice is to take the money now because you can always put the money  in a bank and collect it back with interest in five years time. However, it would be less obvious if the  choice is between $100 now and $125 in five years. This would depend on what return rate you expect  for your money. Another question you can ask is what $100 in five years' time is worth today. There are  more situations and factors to consider. What are they?",,

A data series is a row or column of numbers that are entered in a worksheet and plotted in your chart, such as a list of quarterly business profits. Charts in Office are always associated with an Excel-based worksheet, even if you created your chart in another program, such as Word. If your chart is on the same worksheet as the data you used to create the chart (also known as the source data), you can quickly drag around any new data on the worksheet to add it to the chart. If your chart is on a separate sheet, you'll need to use the Select Data Source dialog box to add a data series.",,
Trend,"You can extend a series of values that fit either a simple linear trend or an exponential growth trend by using the fill handle.
